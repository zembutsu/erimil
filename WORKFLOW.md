# Erimil Workflow

This document defines the development process and collaboration rules for this project.

---

## Development Phases

### Phase Definition

| Phase | Goal | Criteria |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Phase 1 (MVP)** | Core functionality | Browse ZIP, preview images, select exclusions, generate _opt.zip |
| **Phase 2** | Enhanced UX | Export to folder, settings panel, selection mode toggle |
| **Phase 3** | Extended formats | tar.gz/7z support, kurumil integration, batch processing |

### Version Strategy

- **0.x.x**: Pre-release development
- **1.0.0**: First public release (Phase 1 complete)
- **Major**: Breaking changes or major features
- **Minor**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch**: Bug fixes, minor improvements

---

## System-Assisted Development

### Collaboration Model

This project uses AI-assisted development:

```
Human: Define goal/problem
    ↓
System: Propose approach
    ↓
Human: Review & approve approach
    ↓
System: Implement
    ↓
Human: Review & test
    ↓
Human: Commit & merge
```

### Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Human (Zem)** | Vision, approval, review, testing, Git operations, releases |
| **System (Claude)** | Analysis, proposal, implementation, documentation drafts |

### Decision Authority

| Decision Type | Authority |
|---------------|-----------|
| Architecture changes | Human approval required |
| New features | Human approval required |
| Bug fixes (small) | System can implement directly |
| Refactoring (small) | System can implement directly |
| Documentation | System can draft, human reviews |
| Design decisions | Human approval, record in DESIGN.md |

### Communication Protocol

1. **Before implementation**: System proposes approach, waits for approval
2. **Large changes**: Split into phases, propose plan first
3. **During implementation**: Explain changes being made
4. **After implementation**: Provide summary and test guidance
5. **On uncertainty**: Ask for clarification rather than assuming
6. **Design decisions**: Document rationale in DESIGN.md

### Quality Gates

Before proposing implementation complete:
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Changes match approved approach
- [ ] Manual testing performed where possible
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Design decisions recorded

---

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

```
main
  ├── feature/{description}

## Document Lifecycle

### Session Start: Setlist Check

Before starting development, review and organize the work:

1. **GitHub Issues Review**
   - Check Open issues: current status, priorities
   - Identify blockers and dependencies
   - Decide which issues to tackle this session

2. **Session Sheet Setup**
   - Create LOG#\<num\> entry (see Session Sheet template below)
   - Record target issues and goals
   - Note any carry-forward from previous Handoff Bridge

3. **Context Loading**
   - Read PROJECT.md - Confirm current Phase goals
   - Read DESIGN.md - Review past decisions
   - Read LOGBOOK.md (latest entry) - Check Handoff Bridge
   - Check ARCHITECTURE.md Technical Constraints (if relevant)

### During Session: Session Sheet

Maintain a real-time record of the session:

```markdown
## LOG#<num>: <Session Title>
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Issues: #X, #Y, #Z
Actors: Claude, Zem

### Timeline

| Time | Actor | Action | Issue | Status |
|------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 14:00 | Zem | Session start, Setlist Check | - | - |
| 14:05 | Claude | Propose approach for #5 | #5 | 🔄 |
| 14:10 | Zem | Approve approach | #5 | ✅ |
| 14:15 | Claude | Implement fix | #5 | 🔄 |
| 14:30 | Zem | Test - still failing | #5 | ❌ |
| 14:35 | Claude | Step back, check constraints | #5 | 🔄 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Notes
- (Real-time observations, decisions, blockers)

### Outcome
- (Filled at session end)
```

**Status icons**:

## Development Principles

### Troubleshooting Approach

When encountering persistent errors:

1. **Stop guessing** - Don't iterate on assumptions
2. **Check official documentation** - Library READMEs, Apple docs
3. **Search Issues** - GitHub issues often have solutions
4. **Minimal reproduction** - Isolate the problem
5. **Add debug logging** - Understand what's actually happening

**Lesson learned (Phase 1)**:
ZIPFoundation `corruptedData` errors were solved by following official examples, not by adding more workarounds.

### Step Back Before Diving Deeper (Phase 2.1)

When small fixes aren't working after 2-3 attempts:

1. **Stop iterating** - More tweaks often waste time
2. **Ask "what's fundamentally different?"** - Compare working vs broken state
3. **Question assumptions** - "Is this the right approach at all?"
4. **Check platform constraints** - Sandbox, permissions, entitlements
5. **Search for standard patterns** - "How is this normally done on macOS?"

**Anti-pattern**:
```
Fix A → doesn't work → Fix B → doesn't work → Fix C → ...
```

**Better**:
```
Fix A → doesn't work → Fix B → doesn't work → STOP
→ "What would an experienced macOS developer do here?"
→ Check ARCHITECTURE.md Technical Constraints
→ Search for standard approach
```

**Lesson learned (Phase 2.1)**:
Folder restoration kept failing with UserDefaults. After multiple debug iterations, stepping back revealed: "Sandbox requires Security-Scoped Bookmarks" - a fundamental constraint, not a bug to fix.

### SwiftUI State Management

**Timing matters**:
```swift
// ❌ Wrong - sheet opens before image is set
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    previewImage = image
    previewEntry = entry  // triggers sheet with nil image
}

// ✅ Correct - synchronous, image set before sheet trigger
previewImage = image
previewEntry = entry
```

**Parent-child state sharing**:
- Use `@Binding` for shared mutable state
- Parent owns the state, child receives binding
- Callbacks (`onExportSuccess`) for child-to-parent events

**State ownership principle (Phase 2)**:
When derived state (`excludedPaths`) causes false positives, use source state (`selectedPaths`) directly.
```swift
// ❌ Wrong - excludedPaths is calculated, mode-dependent
hasUnsavedChanges: !excludedPaths.isEmpty

// ✅ Correct - selectedPaths is user's actual action
hasUnsavedChanges: !selectedPaths.isEmpty
```

### macOS Sandbox

Common permission issues and solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Cannot write files | Use NSSavePanel + Read/Write entitlement |
| Cannot read user files | Use NSOpenPanel |
| Panel crashes | Check entitlements in Signing & Capabilities |
| Trash files | Use FileManager.trashItem() (works in sandbox) |

### Protocol Abstraction (Phase 2)

When supporting multiple similar sources (ZIP, Folder):

1. **Define protocol early** - Common interface before implementation
2. **Keep protocol minimal** - Only what views actually need
3. **Type-specific logic in implementation** - Not in views
4. **Use `any Protocol`** - For heterogeneous storage

```swift
protocol ImageSource {
    var url: URL { get }
    func listImageEntries() -> [ImageEntry]
    func thumbnail(for: ImageEntry, maxSize: CGFloat) -> NSImage?
    func fullImage(for: ImageEntry) -> NSImage?
}
```

### Finder-style UI (Phase 2)

For tree navigation with content preview:

```swift
// Use List selection binding + OutlineGroup
List(selection: $selectedNodeID) {
    OutlineGroup(nodes, children: \.children) { node in
        NodeRowView(node: node)
            .tag(node.id)  // Required for selection
    }
}
.onChange(of: selectedNodeID) { _, newValue in
    handleSelection(newValue)
}
```

Benefits:
- ▶ disclosure handled automatically
- Row click = selection (not expand)
- Standard macOS behavior

---

## Project-Specific Rules

### Safety Rules

1. **Never implement destructive operations without confirmation**
2. **Original files are read-only until explicit "Confirm"**
3. **All state changes must be undoable until confirmed**

### Code Style

- SwiftUI for all UI
- MVVM-ish (Views + ObservableObject)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Explicit error handling (no silent failures)
